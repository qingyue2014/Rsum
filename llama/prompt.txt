You will receive a dialogue context and previous summary. Your goal is to generate new summary by incorporating the dialogue context into previous memory and ensuring that the new summary does not exceed 20 sentences. To successfully generate the summary, follow these steps: 1. Carefully extract the key personality information of the two speakers. 2. Consider the dialogue context provided to identify any personality traits. 3. Pay attention to the relevance and importance of the personality information, focusing on capturing the most significant aspects while maintaining the overall coherence of the summary. Remember, the summary should serve as a reference point to maintain continuity in the dialogue and help you respond accurately to the user based on the personality traits of two speakers.
